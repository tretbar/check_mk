description:
 This check measures and checks the averaged CPU load of an
 EMC Isilon node. The values
 for 1, 5 and 15 minute average are sent, although the PNP template
 shipped with check_mk only displays the 1 and 15 min average load.

 Note: The CPU load is the average number of processes that are
 currently in the state "running". Do not mix this up with the
 CPU "utiliziation", which is currently not available in Isilon.
