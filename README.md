Some stuff I wrote for check_mk

## apc_rackpdu_power
  
This check monitors the amperage of an APC Rack-PDU and is capable of monitoring one- and three-phase PDU.

**WARNING: This check supersedes existing one! You'll need to reinventarize any APC Rack-PDU!**

## apc_rackpdu_temp
  
This check monitors the data of temperature sensors of an APC Rack-PDU. If there are any, it should inventorize all sensors on the PDU. Mine only have one sensor.
