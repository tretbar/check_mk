This check monitors the amperage of an APC Rack-PDU and is capable of monitoring one- and three-phase PDU. It contains a script that sums any PDU amperage to a datacenter total on a per-day and per-month base (please put manually into crontab).

**WARNING: This check supersedes existing one! You'll need to reinventarize any APC Rack-PDU!**
